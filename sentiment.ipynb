              "  ' Ending of vlog was amazing. I can relate bcoz sometimes i also cant control my anger dealing with elders or Old people but then suddenly I feel like hell that why I did this and that thing ruins my whole day until I go to do something good for the same person... But yes youre right that we should control ourselves when dealing with elders.  Maam i want to share that cats are actually blessings and they are good in many ways for human beings ... So if you are having good feeling toward cats then dont avoid them. They are really good as you will feel positive vibes from them and they reduce your stress when they come to you ',\n",

So the session time and breaks act as a reward system... But ideally the humun mind can have deep focus for an interval of 90 mins... So by using pomodoro we are disrupting that and alot more energy is gone into refocusing....So a humble suggestion... Use a stopwatch instead of a timer... Start when you start studying... Stop when your mind starts to wander and you no longer can focus (when theres like a 40-50% drop in focus) This is what helps me study... Im studying for my ca exams and yes...

Connection/exposure of SVB to Silvergate bank which shutdown a day or 2 before (which is not clear to me).People started looking into the financials of SVB closely even though were past the year end earnings declaration. Investors like Peter Thiel were asking everyone to take out their money from SVB.2. Securities were making losses but not realized since they was a long term bonds. They made a wrong bet',\n",

People/businesses may have realized that short term Treasury yields are around 5% (slight spike/attention due to J Powell said about being stronger with rate hikes on Monday?). SVB was giving 0% on the savings. If the common man/business realizes this',\n",
